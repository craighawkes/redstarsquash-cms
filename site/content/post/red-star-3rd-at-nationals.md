The Red Star D grade women’s team who competed at SuperChamps finals in Taupo
last week are proud to be ranked 3rd best in New Zealand. After winning two out
of three matches to earn a place in the semi-finals, Red Star came up against
top seeds Hawera last Friday.

With four out of five players in the Hawera line-up being teenagers, all having
risen to C grade since teams were seeded, it was always going to be an uphill
battle. “Unfortunately Hawera were youthful, energetic and determined nobody was
going to snatch the trophy away from them,” says Red Star captain Diane Meenken.
“They played fast and strong and kudos to them as they went on to claim the
title in a sporting manner.”

Which left Red Star playing off against Putaruru on Saturday for 3rd/4th place.
Determined to hold their 3rd place seeding, the tie did not begin well with Red
Star narrowly losing their first two matches (Veronica Ordish 1-3 and Shelley
Wilson 2-3).

Thankfully the tide turned with No.1 player Annissa Greenlees beating her
opponent 3-0, followed by No.3 Claudia Hawkes also pulling off a convincing 3-0
win. With the match score tied at 2-2, it was up to Red Star No.2 Sam Woodhouse
to bring it home. No pressure!

Sam played a determined and focused game to win 3-0 and seal the team effort to
earn Red Star their 3rd place accolade. While disappointed not to take out top
honours the team are proud of their achievement, the highest Red Star women have
placed in this grade in over a decade. Look out next year!

For the third successive year Red Star have earned the right to represent
Wellington District at the D-grade Women’s event at the SuperChamps National
Squash tournament, to be held this year in Taupo in late September.

In a tight battle played at Tawa Squash last weekend, the Red Star team
displayed skill and determination to defeat top seeds Thorndon 3-2 in the final.

Results in playing order of 5-4-1-3-2 were:

* Claudia Hawkes 3-0 beat Taya McGillicuddy (15/10, 15/11, 15/11)
* Aysel Greenlees 3-2 beat Caroline Appleton (13/15, 8/15, 15/12, 17/15, 15/11)
* Annissa Greenlees 3-2 beat Emily Willard (11/15, 15/11, 12/15, 15/13, 15/7)
* Shelley Wilson 2-3 lost to Nicole Georgel (15/9, 10/15, 15/11, 18/20, 19/21)
* Sam Woodhouse 0-3 lost to Ella Steventon (Scores not available)

With a team spanning 40-year age gap, captain Diane Meenken feels the
combination of youth and experience proved a winning formula. “As always with
Red Star squashers, it was a team effort from beginning to end. I think going
into the final as underdogs allows one the ability to keep a cool head. The top
seeds feel enormous pressure as, according to the stats, they’re expected to
win. But points on paper don’t take into account the sheer heart and
determination of our girls. Faced with stiff competition, they held their focus
and played excellent squash. The team have done themselves and Red Star proud”.

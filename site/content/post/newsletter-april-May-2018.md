# Club Captainâ€™s Corner

There has been quite a bit going ddsince the last newsletter.

Coaching with Kashif A great day was had by all those who attended coaching from
Kashif Shuja especially those who got to have a game (or 2 aye Big Mike?!).

Business House provided a great opportunity for those who havenâ€™t played squash
at all or much to have a go. It was well supported by members and non-members.

Autumn Interclub has been a success with 3 menâ€™s teams and 2 womenâ€™s teams
entered. Both Womenâ€™s teams finished second in their respective divisions. For
the Menâ€™s divisions, Red Star 1 and 2 both finished third, and Red Star 3 won
their division! Well done teams!! If you are interested in playing Winter
Interclub please let Tracey or Eugene know asap.

Red Star Open is 18-19 May. If youâ€™re not entered but want to help out please
contact us. There is plenty to do during the tournament (small and not so
small), and itâ€™s important to have a smooth running tournament so everyone
enjoys themselves.

Working Bee Prior to the Red Star Open we will be having a working bee to ensure
the club is spic and span for the event. This will be on Sunday 12th May and
many hands make light work!!

Masterton Squash Club Open There was a good turnout of Red Star players entered
in the Masterton Squash Club Open and a number of Red Star entrants took out
prizes in their divisions, including Claudia Hawkes who won her division.

Superchamps Eliminations will be coming up fast. If youâ€™re interested in
competing please let Eugene and/or Tracey know so we can start putting together
teams. Red Star has traditionally competed well in this competition so donâ€™t be
shy!

Clubnight is going well. Braden Woolford has agreed to take over to do the draw
so please contact him to put your name down if you missed the draw sheet on
Thursday night. A big thank you to Peter Clendon for doing the draw prior to
this.

Lets, Ladies & Laughs continues to be well supported. If you know any women who
would like to give squash a go in a friendly, fun environment please get them to
contact Tracey.

Other news If anyone is interested in upskilling their refereeing let us know as
the club may put on a rules night utilising the skill and knowledge of an
experienced referee. This is a good way to build confidence with refereeing.

The club continues to welcome new members. So if you see a new face please
introduce yourself and make them feel welcome.

Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact either Eugene or Tracey to discuss any issues,
thoughts, ideas etc.

# President

Itâ€™s been a busy couple of months at the club with new members signing up it
seems daily â€“ a big thanks to Eugene and Tracey for their efforts.

Red Star travelled on mass to the Whanganui Open â€“ with 15 players and 4
supporters and many were in the money! The large turnout was appreciated by
Whanganui and they are going to bring a few of their own club members down to
play our open on the 18-19th May.

Quotes are starting to come in for replacing the roof above the courts over the
coming summer, the next step will be looking for sponsorship and grants help to
fully cover the costs â€“ with the aim having it completed by the end of summer.

Mike Murphy has the bar fully stocked and ready to go with a few new beverages
to test the palate.

Subs are really starting to roll in and we hope that they are all paid by the
end of the May at the latest. If you need to arrange an automatic payment please
get in touch with Lydia Cribb.

Remember the clubs subs only cover a proportion of what we have to pay to squash
Wellington and NZ squash!

Happy Hitting of a small black ball against a wall.

# Juniors

This Friday we are welcoming any juniors wanting to play this year.
Registrations from 4:30pm - coaching and games will be organised on the night.
Bar and kitchen will also be open.

This year the junior convenors are Jannah and Greg. Please contact them if you
have any questions. And a big thank you to Jaz and Matt Griffith for all their
hard work with juniors over the last few years.

There is a 900 series this Sunday at Khandallah for anyone interested. Please
let convenors know if wanting to play and don't have a ride.

We have had one coaching session with Rod Bannister - Regional Coach, which went
really well and the kids loved it. Thanks to the committee for progressing the
juniors in their squash and funding it! ðŸ˜Š We will definitely be getting him
down again for more coaching!

So if you see junior raffles selling please buy lots; all funds go to the kids
in promoting their squash.

Happy squashing, Greg & Jannah
